## Assignment 1
Our goal is to conduct a study on the job openings of Charles Schwab and PNC Banks which are top US banks and analyze trends in the industry particularly in the area of Fintech. 
The workflow for doing this is:
1.Create a csv of top 100 keywords to describe fintech after using text rank, TF-IDF and Wordcount algorithms on three WEF       articles.
2.Scraping the career websites of the two banks and maintaining a csv files of the job description and the number of times a     keyword is repeated in relation with Fintech.
3.Analyzing the data and drawing useful insights on hiring patterns and trends.

## Assignment 2
Job listings from 24 Banks are scraped in order to build a dataset with features that can be used to analyze hiring trends in Fintech in the 24 largest banks by market cap in the United States. The primary tasks include
1.	Aggregation of multiple datasets into a single dataset
2.	Build a list of 100 keywords in Fintech and assign Fintech categories to each keyword
3.	Tag if a job is a fintech related job or not
4.	Assign the categories as features to each job posting if it is a fintech related job
5.	Analyze the final dataset and document insights.

## Assignment 3
Lending Club is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, where investors provide funds for potential borrowers to earn a profit depending on the risk, they take Lending Club provides acts as the platform between investors and borrowers.
Our case study is an implementation to predict the interest rates of loans disbursed by The Lending club. We are using the Kaggle Lending club dataset.
1.	We have analyzed the client’s needs and explored the statistics presented by the Lending club as well to present the insights for the client Bipa.
2.	We have performed feature engineering on the dataset to obtain multiple features
3.	On the cleaned data set we have applied the 3 ML models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network Model. The MAPE analysis is presented on the models in order to choose the best model
4.	The built models are tuned by applying the hyper-parameter optimization techniques.
5.	Also, AutoML modelling is implemented on the Lending club data and is compared with the manual ML models
6.	Test cases are used to run on the models in order to predict the interest rate.

## Final Project
### KnowYourWords
#### Multi label text toxicity Classification
 
•	The objective of this project is to build a ML model which detects the presence of toxicity in the words of a text. 
•	To detect the toxic comments and develop strategies to minimize unintended bias and develop a prototype to test toxicity prediction of a twitter profile.
•	The dataset was curated from Jigsaw’s toxic text classification dataset. It was tested out by modelling different algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, svm, knn, linear regression, Multinomial Naïve Bayes theorem, etc. and the best one was chosen (Logistic Regression) 
•	The six toxicity labels defined for classification are: Obscene, threat, identity attack, sexual_explicit, insult and severe_toxicity.
•	Detection of bias in comment classification was also done using CNN.
